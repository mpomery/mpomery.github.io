        <h3>Tooling</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Jenkins CI</strong> was the first CI tool I was exposed to during my internship at MRX Technologies.
            I configured a new instance with four agents that I then set up to run soak testing on in the attempt to find an elusive bug. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While working at Bankwest, I have managed several builds in <strong>TeamCity</strong>.
            In the Identity Platform, I built a new build agent so that we could start our new Token Service in Dotnet Core.
            Our internal TeamCity service was not up to date at the time so I built custom scripts to run dotnet commands.
            Our internal instance has since been updated and our build has been updated to use the built in build steps.

        <h3>Ideologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Know how to use every tool at your disposal to it's full extent</li>
            <li>Design it to be simple to build and understand</li>
            <li>Understanding lots of little things is easier than trying to understand one big thing</li>
            <li>If everything in your wardrobe works together, it never takes time/effort to make an outfit</li>
        </ul>
